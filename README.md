# Soundboard

## Datasets

The soundboard project is built using three datasets:

* [**Audioset**](https://research.google.com/audioset/) - Labelled 10 sec audio clips from the Youtube 8M dataset. 

* [**MUSDB**](https://zenodo.org/record/1117372#.ZCWHw-zMJpQ) - 150 (total test & train) songs in multi-track format. Each song has 5 stereo ‘stems’ corresponding to the full mix, drums, bass, the rest of the accompaniment, and vocals.

* [**SampleSwap**](https://sampleswap.org/) - Over 19,000 free sounds including drum beats and loops, drum hits, sound effects, instrument sounds, vocal samples, melodic and electronic loops and more...
